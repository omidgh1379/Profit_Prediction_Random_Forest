First of all, I import the basic data set for analysis and EDA
Then I preprocess the data ( handle categorical, handle missing values, handle duplicate values, handle outliers )
After the preprocessing step, I use a random forest regressor to predict the profit of different products based on how much they sell and the quantity of the products.
After I train the model, I evaluate it using mean square error
